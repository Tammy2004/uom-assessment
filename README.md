# uom-assessment

This repository is a submission for the coding task for University of Manchester's assessment for the position of Research Software Engineer.

Program overview:

The program prompts the user to input an ontology ID. If this ID is valid, the program will then fetch the required details (ontology title, description, number of terms & status). 
After this process, it will ask the user if the details should be printed to the terminal in machine-readable format or human-readable format.

If the ID is invalid, the program will prompt the user until a valid ontology ID is entered.

Usage instructions:

1. Command Line

   python ontology_details.py

2. Visual Studio Code (/any other IDE)

     Open the ontology_details.py file in Visual Studio Code.
     At the right side of the bar with file tabs, find the "Run or Debug" icon (â–·) and click it.

     Alternatively, open a new terminal and use the command line command to run the program.
